  - Accept a borrow request from another user
  - Reject a borrow request from another user
  - List borrow requests I sent
  - Send a message to lender or borrower
    - There must be a book that is currently borrowed from the lender to the borrower
  - List messages to/from a user
  - As an admin, view the status of the library:
    - Current borrowed books
    - Current available (non-borrowed) books
    - Number of accepted/rejected/pending requests

- Assumptions
  - User gets to choose account type on registration
  - Description is needed to differentiate book listing view from detailed view
  - Borrowing a book hides it from the bookstore
    - Returning it unhides it
  - Chatting between lender and borrower is not real-time
  - "accepted/rejected/pending requests so far" means statistics about them (their number) since it falls under
    "provide the admin with the ability to view the overall status of the library"
  - "ACCEPTED" borrow request status is split into "BORROWED" and "RETURNED"
